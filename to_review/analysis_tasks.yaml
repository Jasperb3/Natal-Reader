natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Generate a comprehensive, degree-accurate interpretation of the subject’s natal chart using the full astronomical dataset provided.
    Output should be modular and clearly structured to serve as the analytical backbone for the final report.

    Required analytical coverage:

    - Chart Context:
        - Classify chart shape (e.g., Bucket, Locomotive) and interpret implications for personality flow.
        - Determine diurnal/nocturnal status and analyze sect alignment of each planet.
        - Note Moon phase and house system used.

    - Element, Modality, Hemisphere, and Quadrant Balance:
        - Provide count summaries and interpretations of elemental, modal, hemispheric, and quadrant distributions.
        - Compare dominant and deficient elements/modalities and explain how this contrast may express behaviorally or psychologically.
        - Relate this to psychological temperament and inner vs outer orientation.

    - Ascendant and Chart Ruler:
        - Analyze the rising sign and chart ruler's sign, house, aspects, dignities, motion, and sect.
        - Highlight mutual reception, angularity, and any dispositorship chains.
        - Interpret the chart ruler's overall influence on life trajectory and self-expression.

    - Planetary Positions and Conditions:
        - Analyze each classical planet’s sign, house, decan, dignity/debility, sect status, and motion (direct/retrograde).
        - Include summary of the symbolic meaning of the house each planet occupies.
        - Include minor points (e.g., Chiron, Part of Fortune, Vertex) and nodes with psychological framing.
        - Flag and interpret out-of-bounds planets clearly.
        - Provide one to two grounded psychological or behavioral examples for each planet.

    - Aspects:
        - Identify all major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile) with orb and degree details.
        - Highlight applying vs separating and associative vs dissociate aspects.
        - Flag especially tight aspects (<2° orb) and interpret their intensification.
        - Comment on emotional and interpersonal expression when relevant.

    - Aspect Patterns:
        - Identify and interpret geometric configurations (e.g., T-square, Grand Trine, Yod, Mystic Rectangle).
        - Discuss the planets, houses, and psychological dynamics involved.

    - Planetary Strengths & Focal Points:
        - Highlight planets with high angularity, multiple aspects, rulership, or other prominence.
        - Identify stelliums and repeated thematic clusters (e.g., several planets in same sign or house).

    Output guidelines:
    - Use clean markdown (no code blocks)
    - Maintain interpretive richness anchored in concrete chart features
    - Ensure modularity for seamless integration into report generation

natal_report_writing_task:
  description: >
    Translate the structured natal chart interpretation into a polished, emotionally intelligent, and narratively cohesive report.
    Preserve technical accuracy while enhancing clarity, readability, and real-life relevance.

    Report format (markdown):

    0. Title Block and Chart Header:
        ```
        # Natal Chart for {name}
        Date of Report: {today}

        [natal_chart]

        **Date of Birth:** {date_of_birth}  
        **Place of Birth:** {place_of_birth}
        ```

    1. Introduction:
        - Describe chart type, Moon phase, chart shape, and house system.
        - Present the chart as a developmental map of symbolic potential—not deterministic.

    2. Energetic Balance & Pattern Emphasis:
        - Analyze dominant elements, modalities, hemispheres, and quadrants.
        - Compare dominant vs deficient elemental and modal expressions and interpret behavioral or psychological implications.
        - Interpret how overall distribution affects energy orientation and life approach.

    3. Ascendant & Chart Ruler:
        - Describe life posture and self-presentation via Ascendant.
        - Analyze chart ruler’s house, sign, dignity, and aspects, and discuss its overarching role in the chart’s narrative arc.

    4. Planet-by-Planet Overview:
        - For each planet, include:
            - Sign + house expression
            - Degree + motion
            - Sect status, dignity, and key aspects
            - Summary of house meaning where planet resides
            - One to two psychological or behavioral examples grounded in real-life experience

    5. Aspect Configurations:
        - Identify all major configurations and highlight any tight (<2° orb) aspects.
        - Describe the emotional, cognitive, or interpersonal themes of key aspect groups.
        - Include commentary on the flow or tension between involved houses and functions.

    6. House Emphasis:
        - Point out heavily populated or angular houses.
        - Offer interpretations of how life domains may be emphasized, overdeveloped, under-explored, or challenged.
        - Comment on unoccupied houses where relevant and infer latent potential or de-emphasized life focus.

    7. Psychological and Developmental Themes:
        - Synthesize the chart’s core energetic polarities and archetypal tensions.
        - Discuss inner dynamics, growth arcs, and repeating life motifs that reflect planetary interactions and house activations.

    8. Guidance and Reflections:
        - Offer 3–5 personalized, actionable suggestions or affirmations tied to exact chart features (e.g., house, aspect, planetary rulership).
        - Ensure each item is specific, emotionally intelligent, and growth-oriented.

    9. Conclusion:
        - Recap core chart strengths and growth areas.
        - Reinforce free will and integration as ongoing processes.

    10. Glossary:
        - Provide clear definitions of key astrological terms and jargon used in the report.
        - Ensure explanations are simple, client-facing, and support accessibility for non-experts.

    Style:
    - Markdown format (no code blocks)
    - Supportive, accessible tone
    - Blend symbolic and practical insight
    - Maintain clear structure and internal consistency
