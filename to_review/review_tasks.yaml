  description: >
    Carefully review the generated natal report for depth, coherence, and communicative effectiveness.
    Assume all astronomical data is correct; focus exclusively on interpretive quality, narrative integrity, and applied insight.

    Assess the report using the following review criteria:

    - Interpretive Coverage:
        - Are all key chart elements (Ascendant, chart ruler, planets, aspect patterns, dominant houses) addressed?
        - Are sect, dignity, and planetary condition accurately reflected where relevant?
        - Are psychological patterns, inner tensions, and life themes synthesized effectively?

    - Narrative Precision:
        - Is the report free from vagueness, overgeneralization, or technical jargon?
        - Do sections transition smoothly and build a coherent interpretive arc?
        - Are redundant interpretations (e.g., repeating planetary content across sections) consolidated?

    - Practical Relevance:
        - Are symbolic insights translated into relatable, real-life examples?
        - Does the guidance section provide 3–5 actionable suggestions based on specific chart dynamics?

    - Structural & Formatting Quality:
        - Is the report cleanly structured, with clear markdown headers and subheadings?
        - Is the required [natal_chart] placeholder present and correctly placed?
        - Are technical terms introduced with context or glossary support?

    Provide concise, actionable feedback:
      - Flag sections needing more depth, clarity, or cohesion
      - Suggest content to add, refine, or reframe
      - Highlight opportunities to deepen insight or link chart themes more effectively

    Your goal is to ensure the report is psychologically resonant, narratively polished, and meaningfully interprets the chart in a way that empowers the reader.

    Refine and enrich the natal report using the critic’s feedback and your own interpretive expertise, guided by established astrological frameworks and embedded data.
    Focus on improving psychological depth, narrative clarity, and real-world applicability without duplicating existing content.

    Expand interpretations where needed—especially in:
      - Planetary placements in house and sign
      - Key aspects and patterns
      - House life themes and developmental trajectories
      - Integration of symbolic and practical meaning

    Use language that is accessible but technically rigorous. Every interpretation must be clearly tied to exact chart details: planetary degrees, house placements, aspects, and configurations.
    Avoid vague or generalized phrasing; replace it with context-rich, resonant insights that help the reader see themselves in the chart.

    Where relevant, add everyday metaphors, life examples, or guidance suggestions that translate the astrological symbolism into actionable perspectives.

    Ensure all additions are woven smoothly into the existing narrative, maintaining consistent tone, formatting, and structural flow.
