natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Generate a comprehensive, degree-accurate interpretation of the subject's natal chart using the full astronomical dataset provided.
    Use the tools available to you to research information and find additional details relevant to the subject's chart.
    Output should be modular and clearly structured to serve as the analytical backbone for the final report.

    Required analytical coverage:

    - Chart Context:
        - Classify chart shape (e.g., Bucket, Locomotive) and interpret implications for personality flow.
        - Determine diurnal/nocturnal status and analyze sect alignment of each planet.
        - Note Moon phase and house system used.

    - Element, Modality, Hemisphere, and Quadrant Balance:
        - Provide count summaries and interpretations of elemental, modal, hemispheric, and quadrant distributions.
        - Compare dominant and deficient elements/modalities and explain how this contrast may express behaviorally or psychologically.
        - Relate this to psychological temperament and inner vs outer orientation.

    - Ascendant and Chart Ruler:
        - Analyze the rising sign and chart ruler's sign, house, aspects, dignities, motion, and sect.
        - Highlight mutual reception, angularity, and any dispositorship chains.
        - Interpret the chart ruler's overall influence on life trajectory and self-expression.

    - Planetary Positions and Conditions:
        - Analyze each classical planet's sign, house, decan, dignity/debility, sect status, and motion (direct/retrograde).
        - Include a summary of the symbolic meaning of the house each planet occupies.
        - Include minor points (e.g., Chiron, Part of Fortune, Vertex, Lilith variations, Juno, Ceres) and lunar nodes with psychological framing.
        - Flag and interpret out-of-bounds planets clearly, discussing their potential unconventional expressions.
        - Provide one to two grounded psychological or behavioral examples for each planet.

    - Aspects:
        - Identify all major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile, quincunx) with orb and degree details.
        - Distinguish applying vs separating and associative vs dissociate aspects.
        - Flag tight aspects (<2° orb) and interpret their intensification clearly.
        - Group aspects thematically (communication, transformation, relationships, drive, etc.).
        - Highlight configurations (T-squares, yods, grand trines) if present.

    - Points and Angles:
        - Analyze Ascendant, Descendant, MC, IC angles individually, emphasizing their role in life direction, relational dynamics, and private vs public identity.
        - Provide interpretations for symbolic points (Chiron, Nodes, Lilith variants, Vertex, Ceres, Juno, and Part of Fortune), emphasizing karmic or spiritual implications and integrating real-life scenarios.

    - Eclipse and Syzygy Influence:
        - Clearly analyze pre- and post-natal solar and lunar eclipses as indicators of inherited karmic patterns, transformational crises, or major life milestones.
        - Interpret the natal syzygy point as an evolutionary anchor shaping identity and psychological temperament.

    - Planetary Strengths & Focal Points:
        - Highlight planets with high angularity, multiple aspects, rulership, or other prominence.
        - Identify stelliums and repeated thematic clusters (e.g., several planets in same sign or house) and their narrative significance.

    Output guidelines:
    - Use clean markdown (no code blocks)
    - Maintain interpretive richness anchored in concrete chart features
    - Degree-accurate and evidence-based
    - Ensure modularity for seamless integration into report generation

natal_report_writing_task:
  description: >
    Translate the structured natal chart interpretation into a polished, emotionally intelligent, and narratively cohesive report.
    Preserve all technical accuracy from the interpretation while enhancing clarity, psychological depth, and practical resonance.

    Goal:
    - Present the chart as a symbolic, developmental map.
    - Make each section self-contained yet part of a larger narrative.
    - Write with emotional intelligence, practical insight, and symbolic clarity.
    - Never add or infer new data beyond what is in the provided interpretation.

    Report Format (Markdown, no code blocks):

    0. **Title Block and Chart Header**
        ```
        # Natal Chart for {name}
        Date of Report: {today}

        [natal_chart]

        **Date of Birth:** {date_of_birth}  
        **Place of Birth:** {place_of_birth}
        ```

    1. **Introduction**
        - Briefly describe chart type, house system, chart shape, and Moon phase.
        - Set the tone: symbolic map of potential, not deterministic fate.

    2. **Energetic Balance & Pattern Emphasis**
        - Summarize elemental, modal, hemispheric, and quadrant distributions.
        - Contrast dominant vs missing energies.
        - Discuss how this energetic landscape influences life orientation and psychological style.

    3. **Core Identity: The Big 3**
        - **Ascendant**: Instinctive approach, life posture, and self-presentation.
        - **Sun**: Core vitality, personal purpose, and conscious direction.
        - **Moon**: Emotional regulation, internal needs, memory, and comfort-seeking.
        - **Synthesis**: Discuss coherence or tension among the Big 3 and their joint effect on selfhood and identity development.

    4. **Planetary Psychology and Celestial Dynamics**
        - **Chart Ruler**: Sign, house, aspects, dignity; its role as thematic bridge and guide.
        - **Classical Planets (Mercury to Saturn)**:
            - Interpret sign + house expression, motion, dignity, and key aspects.
            - Highlight behavioral tendencies, inner tensions, and real-world manifestations.
        - **Modern Planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto)**:
            - Frame as generational or unconscious forces shaping long-term change and individuation.
        - **Minor Bodies and Symbolic Points**:
            - Chiron, Nodes, Liliths, Vertex, Juno, Ceres, Part of Fortune.
            - Tie each to psychological narratives, archetypal patterns, or developmental tension.

    5. **Aspects & Archetypal Dynamics**
        - Highlight tight, significant aspects and configurations.
        - Emphasize key inner dynamics (e.g., will vs sensitivity, mind vs heart).
        - Group thematically (communication, drive, relationship, transformation).
        - Avoid raw aspect lists—always interpret functionally and emotionally.

    6. **Eclipse and Syzygy Significance**
        - Interpret pre/post-natal eclipses as karmic or crisis-inducing points.
        - Frame the syzygy point as an identity-shaping backdrop to life direction.

    7. **House Emphasis**
        - Highlight houses of planetary concentration or angularity.
        - Discuss life domains of focused energy, growth, avoidance, or challenge.

    8. **Psychological and Developmental Themes**
        - Synthesize overarching conflicts, recurring motifs, and core polarities.
        - Explore tension arcs, emotional growth, or coping strategies.
        - Avoid clinical tone—use vivid but grounded metaphors or language.

    9. **Guidance and Reflections**
        - Offer 3–5 actionable insights grounded in specific chart features.
        - Ensure suggestions are empowering, emotionally relevant, and concretely applicable.

    10. **Conclusion**
        - Recap strengths, challenges, and personal trajectory.
        - Reinforce the idea of lifelong symbolic integration.

    11. **Glossary**
        - Briefly define key technical or symbolic terms in accessible language.
