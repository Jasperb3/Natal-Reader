natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Generate a comprehensive, degree-accurate interpretation of the subject's
    natal chart using the full astronomical dataset provided. Use the tools
    available to you to research information and find additional details
    relevant to the subject's chart.

    Output should be modular and clearly structured to serve as the analytical
    backbone for the final report.

    Required analytical coverage:

    - Chart Context:
        - Classify chart shape and interpret implications for personality flow.
        - Determine diurnal/nocturnal status and analyze sect alignment of each planet.
        - Note Moon phase and house system used.
        - Reference the pre-computed patterns section for chart ruler, stelliums,
          hemisphere balance, and mutual receptions — verify and expand upon them.

    - Element, Modality, Hemisphere, and Quadrant Balance:
        - Provide count summaries and interpretations.
        - Compare dominant and deficient elements/modalities and explain behavioral
          or psychological expression.
        - Relate to psychological temperament and inner vs outer orientation.

    - Ascendant and Chart Ruler:
        - Analyze the rising sign and chart ruler's sign, house, aspects, dignities,
          motion, and sect.
        - Highlight mutual reception, angularity, and dispositorship chains.
        - Interpret the chart ruler's overall influence on life trajectory.

    - Planetary Positions and Conditions:
        - For each planet (Sun through Pluto): sign, house, decan, dignity/debility,
          sect status, motion (direct/retrograde).
        - Include symbolic meaning of the house each planet occupies.
        - Include Chiron (wound/healing axis), Lilith (shadow/instinct), and the
          Lunar Nodes (True North and South Node) with psychological framing.
        - Flag and interpret out-of-bounds planets with unconventional expressions.
        - Provide 1-2 grounded psychological or behavioral examples per planet.

    - Aspects:
        - Identify all major aspects with orb and degree details.
        - Distinguish applying vs separating and associative vs dissociate.
        - Flag tight aspects (<2° orb) from the pre-computed summary and interpret
          their intensification.
        - Group aspects thematically (communication, transformation, relationships, drive).
        - Highlight configurations (T-squares, yods, grand trines) if present.

    - Points and Angles:
        - Analyze Asc, Desc, MC, IC individually — note any anaretic (29°)
          or otherwise significant degrees on the angles.
        - Interpret Chiron (core wound and healing gift), Lilith (primal
          instinct and shadow integration), and the True Lunar Nodes
          (evolutionary direction from South Node past to North Node future).

    - Planetary Strengths & Focal Points:
        - Highlight planets with high angularity, multiple aspects, or rulership.
        - Identify stelliums and thematic clusters.

    Constraints:
    - Do NOT fabricate aspects, degrees, or placements not present in the chart data.
    - Do NOT infer house rulership systems beyond what the data provides.
    - If a data point is absent, state that explicitly rather than inventing one.
    - Cite specific degrees and orbs from the data when making claims.
    - Every claim must be traceable to a specific data point in the chart.

    Output guidelines:
    - Clean markdown (no code blocks)
    - Degree-accurate and evidence-based
    - Maintain interpretive richness anchored in concrete chart features
    - Ensure modularity for seamless integration into report generation
    - Target 3,000–5,000 words

natal_report_writing_task:
  description: >
    Translate the structured natal chart interpretation into a polished,
    psychologically astute, and narratively cohesive report. Faithfully preserve
    all technical accuracy from the interpretation while enhancing emotional
    resonance, symbolic depth, and practical relevance.

    Goal:
    - Present the chart as a symbolic, evolving life map — developmental potentials
      rather than deterministic outcomes.
    - Craft each section as a self-contained thematic unit while weaving them
      into a unified personal narrative.
    - Write with emotional intelligence, psychological nuance, and archetypal clarity.
    - Never extrapolate, speculate, or introduce data beyond the provided interpretation.

    Report Structure (Markdown, no code blocks):

    **Title Block and Chart Header** (~50 words)
        ```
        # Natal Chart for {name}
        Date of Report: {today}

        [natal_chart]

        **Date of Birth:** {date_of_birth}
        **Place of Birth:** {place_of_birth}
