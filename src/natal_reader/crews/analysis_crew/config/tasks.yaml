natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Generate a comprehensive, degree-accurate interpretation of the subject's natal chart using the full astronomical dataset provided.
    Use the tools available to you to research information and find additional details relevant to the subject's chart.
    Output should be modular and clearly structured to serve as the analytical backbone for the final report.

    Required analytical coverage:

    - Chart Context:
        - Classify chart shape (e.g., Bucket, Locomotive) and interpret implications for personality flow.
        - Determine diurnal/nocturnal status and analyze sect alignment of each planet.
        - Note Moon phase and house system used.

    - Element, Modality, Hemisphere, and Quadrant Balance:
        - Provide count summaries and interpretations of elemental, modal, hemispheric, and quadrant distributions.
        - Compare dominant and deficient elements/modalities and explain how this contrast may express behaviorally or psychologically.
        - Relate this to psychological temperament and inner vs outer orientation.

    - Ascendant and Chart Ruler:
        - Analyze the rising sign and chart ruler's sign, house, aspects, dignities, motion, and sect.
        - Highlight mutual reception, angularity, and any dispositorship chains.
        - Interpret the chart ruler's overall influence on life trajectory and self-expression.

    - Planetary Positions and Conditions:
        - Analyze each classical planet's sign, house, decan, dignity/debility, sect status, and motion (direct/retrograde).
        - Include a summary of the symbolic meaning of the house each planet occupies.
        - Include minor points (e.g., Chiron, Part of Fortune, Vertex, Lilith variations, Juno, Ceres) and lunar nodes with psychological framing.
        - Flag and interpret out-of-bounds planets clearly, discussing their potential unconventional expressions.
        - Provide one to two grounded psychological or behavioral examples for each planet.

    - Aspects:
        - Identify all major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile, quincunx) with orb and degree details.
        - Distinguish applying vs separating and associative vs dissociate aspects.
        - Flag tight aspects (<2° orb) and interpret their intensification clearly.
        - Group aspects thematically (communication, transformation, relationships, drive, etc.).
        - Highlight configurations (T-squares, yods, grand trines) if present.

    - Points and Angles:
        - Analyze Ascendant, Descendant, MC, IC angles individually, emphasizing their role in life direction, relational dynamics, and private vs public identity.
        - Provide interpretations for symbolic points (Chiron, Nodes, Lilith variants, Vertex, Ceres, Juno, and Part of Fortune), emphasizing karmic or spiritual implications and integrating real-life scenarios.

    - Eclipse and Syzygy Influence:
        - Clearly analyze pre- and post-natal solar and lunar eclipses as indicators of inherited karmic patterns, transformational crises, or major life milestones.
        - Interpret the natal syzygy point as an evolutionary anchor shaping identity and psychological temperament.

    - Planetary Strengths & Focal Points:
        - Highlight planets with high angularity, multiple aspects, rulership, or other prominence.
        - Identify stelliums and repeated thematic clusters (e.g., several planets in same sign or house) and their narrative significance.

    Output guidelines:
    - Use clean markdown (no code blocks)
    - Maintain interpretive richness anchored in concrete chart features
    - Degree-accurate and evidence-based
    - Ensure modularity for seamless integration into report generation

  description: >
    Translate the structured natal chart interpretation into a polished, emotionally intelligent, and narratively cohesive report.
    Use the tools available to you to research information and find additional details relevant to the subject's chart.
    Preserve technical accuracy while enhancing clarity, readability, and real-life relevance.

    Report format (markdown):

    0. Title Block and Chart Header:
        ```
        # Natal Chart for {name}
        Date of Report: {today}

        [natal_chart]

        **Date of Birth:** {date_of_birth}  
        **Place of Birth:** {place_of_birth}
        ```

    1. Introduction:
        - Briefly explain chart shape, Moon phase, chart type, and house system.
        - Frame the chart as symbolic potential, not fate.

    2. Energetic Balance & Pattern Emphasis:
        - Summarize elemental/modal/hemisphere/quadrant balance.
        - Discuss psychological orientation and dominant vs missing energies.
        - Tie this to emotional tone, interpersonal style, and life attitude.

    3. Ascendant & Chart Ruler:
        - Describe instinctive approach, life posture and self-presentation via Ascendant.
        - Analyze chart ruler's house, sign, dignity, and aspects, discussing its overarching role and influence.

    4. Planetary Overview:
        - One section per planet.For each planet provide a thorough and comprehensive overview including:
            - Sign + house + aspects (plain language, not symbolic codes)
            - Behavioral traits, coping styles, inner drives
            - Example of real-world expression

        - Clearly integrate symbolic points (Chiron, Nodes, Vertex, etc.) and explain them in psychological or karmic terms.

    5. Aspects & Archetypal Dynamics:
        - Clearly detail major configurations and highlight tight aspects (<2° orb).
        - Emphasize emotional, interpersonal, and cognitive patterns.
