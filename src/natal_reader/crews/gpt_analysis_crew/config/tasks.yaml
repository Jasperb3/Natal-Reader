natal_chart_interpretation_task:
  description: >
    Generate a comprehensive, degree-accurate interpretation of the subject's natal chart using the full astronomical dataset provided.
    Use the tools available to you to research information and find additional details relevant to the subject's chart.
    Output should be modular and clearly structured to serve as the analytical backbone for the final report.

    Required analytical coverage:

    - Chart Context:
        - Classify chart shape (e.g., Bucket, Locomotive) and interpret implications for personality flow.
        - Determine diurnal/nocturnal status and analyze sect alignment of each planet.
        - Note Moon phase and house system used.

    - Element, Modality, Hemisphere, and Quadrant Balance:
        - Provide count summaries and interpretations of elemental, modal, hemispheric, and quadrant distributions.
        - Compare dominant and deficient elements/modalities and explain how this contrast may express behaviorally or psychologically.
        - Relate this to psychological temperament and inner vs outer orientation.

    - Ascendant and Chart Ruler:
        - Analyze the rising sign and chart ruler's sign, house, aspects, dignities, motion, and sect.
        - Highlight mutual reception, angularity, and any dispositorship chains.
        - Interpret the chart ruler's overall influence on life trajectory and self-expression.

    - Planetary Positions and Conditions:
        - Analyze each classical planet's sign, house, decan, dignity/debility, sect status, and motion (direct/retrograde).
        - Include a summary of the symbolic meaning of the house each planet occupies.
        - Include minor points (e.g., Chiron, Part of Fortune, Vertex, Lilith variations, Juno, Ceres) and lunar nodes with psychological framing.
        - Flag and interpret out-of-bounds planets clearly, discussing their potential unconventional expressions.
        - Provide one to two grounded psychological or behavioral examples for each planet.

    - Aspects:
        - Identify all major aspects (conjunction, opposition, trine, square, sextile, quincunx) with orb and degree details.
        - Distinguish applying vs separating and associative vs dissociate aspects.
        - Flag tight aspects (<2° orb) and interpret their intensification clearly.
        - Group aspects thematically (communication, transformation, relationships, drive, etc.).
        - Highlight configurations (T-squares, yods, grand trines, etc.) if present.

    - Points and Angles:
        - Analyze Ascendant, Descendant, MC, IC angles individually, emphasizing their role in life direction, relational dynamics, and private vs public identity.
        - Provide interpretations for all symbolic points (including but not limited to Chiron, Nodes, Lilith variants, Vertex, Ceres, Juno, Part of Fortune), emphasizing karmic or spiritual implications and integrating real-life scenarios.

    - Eclipse and Syzygy Influence:
        - Clearly analyze pre- and post-natal solar and lunar eclipses as indicators of inherited karmic patterns, transformational crises, or major life milestones.
        - Interpret the natal syzygy point as an evolutionary anchor shaping identity and psychological temperament.

    - Planetary Strengths & Focal Points:
        - Highlight planets with high angularity, multiple aspects, rulership, or other prominence.
        - Identify stelliums and repeated thematic clusters (e.g., several planets in same sign or house) and their narrative significance.

    Output guidelines:
    - Use clean markdown (no code blocks)
    - Maintain interpretive richness anchored in concrete chart features
    - Degree-accurate and evidence-based
    - Ensure modularity for seamless integration into report generation

natal_report_writing_task:
  description: >
    Translate the structured natal chart interpretation into a polished, psychologically astute, and narratively cohesive report.
    Faithfully preserve all technical accuracy from the interpretation while enhancing emotional resonance, symbolic depth, and practical relevance.

    Goal:
    - Present the chart as a symbolic, evolving life map, highlighting developmental potentials rather than deterministic outcomes.
    - Craft each section as a self-contained thematic unit, while weaving them seamlessly into a unified personal narrative.
    - Write with emotional intelligence, psychological nuance, and archetypal clarity.
    - Never extrapolate, speculate, or introduce data beyond the provided interpretation.

    Report Format (Markdown, no code blocks):

    0. **Title Block and Chart Header**
        ```
        # Natal Chart for {name}
        Date of Report: {today}

        [natal_chart]

        **Date of Birth:** {date_of_birth}  
        **Place of Birth:** {place_of_birth}
        ```

    1. **Introduction**
        - Briefly introduce chart type, house system, chart shape, and Moon phase.
        - Establish the tone: a symbolic blueprint of potentials, not a fixed destiny.

    2. **Energetic Balance & Pattern Emphasis**
        - Summarize elemental, modal, hemispheric, and quadrant distributions.
        - Contrast dominant and underrepresented energies.
        - Discuss how the energetic landscape shapes core life orientation and psychological patterns.

    3. **Core Identity: The Big 3**
        - **Ascendant**: Instinctive approach to life, social presentation, and immediate coping style.
        - **Sun**: Core vitality, conscious will, and life purpose.
        - **Moon**: Emotional regulation, memory patterns, internal security needs.
        - **Synthesis**: Analyze how the Big 3 interact dynamically, indicating self-coherence or developmental tension in identity formation.

    4. **Planetary Psychology and Celestial Dynamics**
        - **Chart Ruler**: Sign, house, aspects, and dignity; interpreted as the primary agent linking the personality's overarching narrative.
        - **Classical Planets (Mercury–Saturn)**:
            - Interpret psychological function through sign, house, motion, dignity, and key aspects.
            - Emphasize behavioral expressions, core tensions, and life manifestations.
        - **Modern Planets (Uranus, Neptune, Pluto)**:
            - Frame as generational or unconscious forces guiding individuation and deep transformation.
        - **Minor Bodies and Symbolic Points**:
            - Include Chiron, Nodes, Liliths, Vertex, Juno, Ceres, Part of Fortune.
            - Connect these to developmental arcs, archetypal themes, or psycho-spiritual challenges.

    5. **Aspects & Archetypal Dynamics**
        - Focus on significant aspects and configurations, especially tight ones.
        - Highlight major intrapsychic conflicts or synergies (e.g., will vs. sensitivity, thought vs. feeling).
        - Group interpretations thematically (communication, vitality, relationships, transformation).
        - Prioritize functional, emotionally resonant interpretation over raw listing.

    6. **Eclipse and Syzygy Significance**
        - Interpret pre-/post-natal eclipses as markers of karmic tension or crisis points.
        - Present the syzygy as a symbolic backdrop informing the chart-holder’s core developmental themes.

    7. **House Emphasis**
        - Highlight concentration or angular emphasis within houses.
        - Discuss life domains of focused evolution, opportunity, avoidance, or recurring challenge.

    8. **Psychological and Developmental Themes**
        - Synthesize recurrent motifs, inner polarities, and key developmental arcs.
        - Frame psychological evolution with vivid, grounded metaphors rather than clinical abstraction.

    9. **Guidance and Reflections**
        - Offer 3–5 actionable insights directly rooted in specific chart patterns.
        - Ensure guidance is empowering, emotionally validating, and pragmatically applicable.

    10. **Conclusion**
        - Recap strengths, tensions, and potential life trajectory.
        - Reaffirm the lifelong process of symbolic integration and self-development.
